# Dragon Magic And Relics
A minecraft mod to expand your magic to compete with gods!
<br>This mod is an extension for the magic mod [Mana and Artifice](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mana-and-artifice) for version 1.18.2.
The amazing armor [model](/src/main/resources/assets/dragonmagicandrelics/geo/dragon_mage_armor.geo.json)
and [texture](/src/main/resources/assets/dragonmagicandrelics/textures/models/armor/infernal_dragon_mage_armor_texture.png)
of the Dragon Mage Armor were created by [jsementj](https://www.reddit.com/user/jsementj/). And thanks to Mithion for helping creating the mod. Also thanks to Ceddi and Nico for helping with testing and balancing.
<br>The full credits can be viewed [here](/CREDITS.md). 

The Codex has all the necessary information about the added elements.
<br>The main focus of this mod is for the use in modpacks to extend the late and after game of Mana and Artifice and make it on par with other high level mods. The mod can be added to modpacks. No need to ask.

## Dragon Mage Armor
![The Dragon Mage Armor](/src/main/resources/the_dragon_mage_armor.png)

This armor is an upgrade of the faction armor. It takes over some of the properties of the base faction armor, but it can still be expanded with a variety of glyphs through rituals. Flying, damage boost, an increase in my mana capacity and a lot more!
<br>Another way to maximize the potential of the Dragon Mage Armor is to fuse it with your spells!
