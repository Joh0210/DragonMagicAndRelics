**Unleash your magical potential and challenge the gods!**
<br>Dragon Magic and Relics is an endgame expansion for [Mana and Artifice](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mana-and-artifice) in Minecraft, adding powerful gear, rituals, and spells.
<br>The main focus of this mod is for the use in modpacks to extend the late and after game of Mana and Artifice and make it on par with other high level mods. The mod can be added to modpacks. No need to ask.
